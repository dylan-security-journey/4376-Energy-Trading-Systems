- Underground caverns (salt dome/aquifers)  

**Other assets**  
- Compressor stations  
- Metering stations  

---

## Slide 9: Physical Pipelines
- **Gathering Systems**: small diameter, to plants, common point meters  
- **Transmission Systems**: large diameter, interstate, long-haul  
- **Distribution Systems**: small diameter, end-user delivery, city gates  
- Across all: custody meters, interconnects, compressor stations, pigs, orifice plates  

---

## Slide 10: Compressor Stations
- Drive natural gas to destination (powered by NG or electricity)  
- 40‚Äì100 miles apart  
- Key elements: scrubbers, filters, separators  
- Efficiency depends on age & FERC approvals  

---

## Slide 11: Processing ‚Äì Plants / Equipment
- **Field Processing (cost basis)**: gravity, scrubber, heater filters, separators  
- **Plant Processing (fee basis)**: gasoline, dehydration, NGL plants  

---

## Slide 12: Natural Gas Processing Plants
- Responsible for conditioning raw natural gas  

---

## Slide 13: Physical Storage
- **Types**:  
  - Above ground (man-made)  
  - Below ground (depleted reservoirs, aquifers, salt caverns)  
- **Purposes**:  
  - Base load (seasonal demand)  
  - Peak load (short-term demand)  
- Facilities mainly in the North; mostly purchased by LDCs  

---

## Slide 14: Production
- 6,300+ producers in the U.S.  
- Range: large integrated majors ‚Üí small independents  
- 21 ‚Äúmajors‚Äù active in U.S. (Shell, BP, ExxonMobil, Hess, etc.)  

---

## Slide 15: Processing
- 530+ U.S. natural gas processing plants  
- Processed ~15 Tcf gas; extracted 630M+ barrels NGLs (2006)  
- Companies: Texaco Mobil, Duke Energy Gas, etc.  

---

## Slide 16: Pipelines
- 160+ pipeline companies  
- Operate 300,000+ miles of pipe (180,000 interstate)  
- Capacity: 148 Bcf/day transport  
- Examples: NNG, NGPL, EPNG, Transco  

---

## Slide 17: Storage
- 123 operators manage ~400 underground facilities  
- Storage capacity: 4,059 Bcf; 85 Bcf/day deliverability  
- EIA runs weekly storage survey  
- Companies: Sempra, Chevron NGS, Floridian NG Storage  

---

## Slide 18: End Users
- 1,200+ local distribution companies, 1.2M miles of pipe  
- **Sectors**:  
  - Residential: long-term heating driver  
  - Commercial: 1.7% annual growth (to 2025)  
  - Industrial: 1.2% annual growth  
  - Electric generation: 1.8% annual growth  
- Examples: Reliant Stadium, King Ranch, GMAC Plant  

---

## Slide 19: Operations ‚Äì Focus
- How the industry runs  
- The people who run it  

---

## Slide 20: Gas Industry Fundamentals (Reinforced)
- Supply ‚Üí Transport ‚Üí Processing ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Demand  

---

## Slide 21: Measurement
- **Units**:  
  - MCF = 1,000 cubic feet  
  - BTU = energy to heat/cool 1 lb of water by 1¬∞F  
  - MMBTU = 1,000,000 BTUs  
- Conversion: Mcf √ó BTU = MMBTU ‚Üí priced into $  

---

## Slide 22: Pipeline Maintenance & Measurement
