# Market Supply & Market Demand — Detailed Notes (Natural Gas)

## 1) Big Picture
- Natural gas business spans **supply (acquire)** → **logistics** → **demand (dispose)**.
- “Acquire & Dispose” shows how volumes enter and exit the system in accounting terms.

---

## 2) Acquire & Dispose (Flow Components)
### Acquisitions / Supply (In)
- **Purchase / Production (Initial)**
- **Storage Withdraw**
- **Imbalance In**

### Dispositions / Demand (Out)
- **Sells / City Gate**
- **Retained Fuel**
- **Storage Injection**
- **Imbalance Out**

> Mental model: *Receipts in* (acquisitions) are allocated to *deliveries out* (dispositions), with **retained fuel** treated explicitly.

---

## 3) Layered Approach to the Industry
View the industry as stacked layers; each layer supports the next:
1. **Physical Assets**
2. **Purpose / Objectives**
3. **Operational Management**
4. **Players / Roles**
5. **Business Management**
6. **Technology / Communications**
7. **Controls & Compliance**
8. **Accounting / Settlement Reporting**

> Use this to organize notes/interview answers: “assets → ops → players → business → tech → controls → accounting.”

---

## 4) Business Management Layer — Contracts (Commodity Agreements)
Contracts govern buying/selling **gas units (commodity)**.

### Contract Types
- **Non-Firm (Spot / Swing)**
  - Shorter term, flexible.
  - Delivery on **best efforts**; can be **cut/zeroed out**.
  - **No legal recourse** for non-performance.
- **Firm**
  - Longer term, **base-load** oriented.
  - **Guaranteed delivery** except **Act of God**.
  - Highest performance priority.
  - **Legal recourse** typically available.

> **Keep-Whole Provision:** Settlement mechanism to make counterparties “whole” when deviations occur.

---

## 5) Service Types & Standards Evolution
- **Legacy Contracts**
  - Single-purpose (Purchase **or** Sale).
  - Both **Firm** and **Non-Firm** exist.
  - Non-performance handled via **penalties**.

- **GISB (1996)** — Gas Industry Standards Board
  - **Dual-purpose** (Purchase **and** Sales) contract format.
  - **Standardized** contract language.

- **NAESB (2002)** — North American Energy Standards Board
  - **Dual-purpose**; non-performance via **Keep-Whole**.
  - **Optimized settlement** through **net invoicing**.

---

## 6) Charges & Pricing (What’s on the Invoice)
### Firm Demand Charges (Reservation)
- Pay for **reserved rights/availability** (used or not).
- Often split into **base-load** and **swing** provisions.
- Non-performance of base-load ⇒ **penalties**.

### Commodity Charges (Usage)
- **Flat/Fixed/Stated** price.
- **Index** price (± premium).
- **Basket**-calculated pricing.
- **Firm Keep-Whole** (see spreadsheet examples in class for math).

### Fees & Taxes
- **Marketing fees** for broker services.
- **State taxes** (e.g., based on **first purchaser**).

---

## 7) Players & Their Objectives (Price Tension)
- **Producers:** Sell at the **highest price**.
- **Marketers:** Capture **margin** (buy low / sell higher; manage logistics).
- **LDCs (Local Distribution Companies):** Ensure **reliability** of deliverability.
- **End Users:** Buy at the **lowest price**.

---

## 8) How Price Builds Up (Know These Terms)
- **Purchase Price:** Cost to **acquire** supply units.
- **Logistical Price:** **Transport / Processing / Storage** and related costs to move supply to demand.
- **Landed Price:** **Purchase + Logistical** (the **all-in** cost to the delivery point).
- **Sales Price:** **Negotiated** price to the buyer.

> Interview tip: “Our **landed** cost was $X/MMBtu; we priced sales off **index + premium** to cover logistics and margin.”

---

## 9) Where Trading Happens (ICE)
- **Intercontinental Exchange (ICE)** is a key marketplace for trading (physicals/financials), price discovery, and hedging.

---

## 10) Practical Takeaways / Interview Soundbites
- “**Firm vs Non-Firm** defines delivery priority and **legal recourse**; NAESB modernized language and **net invoicing**.”
- “**Landed price** = purchase + logistics; marketers monetize the **spread** between landed cost and **sales**.”
- “**Acquire & Dispose** maps how receipts feed deliveries, with **retained fuel** and **storage** explicitly modeled.”
- “Think in **layers**: assets → operations → players → contracts → controls → accounting.”

---

## 11) Quick Glossary
- **Base-Load:** Steady, guaranteed quantity under a firm contract.
- **Swing:** Variable quantity around base-load, often priced differently.
- **Keep-Whole:** Settlement method to make parties financially whole for deviations.
- **Imbalance In/Out:** Accounting of over/under-deliveries versus scheduled volumes.
- **Landed Price:** All-in cost at the delivery location (purchase + logistics).
